# $Black Jack$

## Description:

  This is a game for the ages. "Black Jack!" They shout whenever 21 hits. Thats because in this game its all about the points and 21 is the magic number. But watch out its not just you in the race. You have to face off with the dreaded Casino card dealer or "CCD". No this is not catholic school. Together you will both be dealt two cards a peice. The dealer likes you so he will show you one of his cards but the other remains a mystery. It is your job to get as close to or hit 21 while staying above what you think the dealer has. You are dealt two cards: if you are looking a little low on points don't worry just click the "Hit" button for another card as many times as you would like without going over 21. Beware if you so much as go over by a single point you will be swimming with the fishes or just lose a hand. I mean your hand! Oh no, I mean the hand! If the dealer goes over 21 and you are still under then winner winner chicken dinner. If you happen to catch the illusive Ace/Jack or any two card combination equaling 21, that is an automatic win with a little bonus on the side! Easy right, lets recap. The game is 21 and you have to beat the dealer by not going over but still staying above him. Got it! Good. Ill see you at the table...

##Technologies

- I used bootstrap for my button collection
- I used JQuery and javascript to manipulate the DOM
- I imported 'Pacifico' font from google to style my page
- I downloaded card images from BoiseCodeWorks Github to render real BlackJack cards
- I used setTimeout functions to control flow.

##Version 2

     I would like to update this application in version 2 to support a chip count and betting options. Also, adding more animations and sound effects would really polish this application. In version 2 the player would have a better experience with better responsiveness on different platforms. I would also like to add the option for avatars as well as collecting the users name. Another idea would be to setup up a data collector so each hand played could be reviewed and odds could be determined at the time of play.
